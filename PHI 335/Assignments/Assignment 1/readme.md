# Assignment 1

Explain why (give reasons why) you chose the photo that did not imitate well. Questions you might address: How was the mimesis (imitation) not good? What was the thing that was imitated, and how did the photo fail to capture it? What could you change about this photo that would make it a better imitation.  Be sure to address features of the photo, not just “what’s in it.”

## Answer:

The photo that appears to be the worst imitation of its contents is the photo of my last apartment's kitchen.

The lighting of the photo steals attention to the middle of the photo and the glaring lights, and the uniform lighting throughout leaves it feeling utilitarian. The photo is also dominated by the carpet of the surrounding area and the doors of the utility closet, without a clear focus on the kitchen.

This is in stark contrast to how I feel about a kitchen. The kitchen is a central part to every home. It's defined by the warmth of the oven, the aroma of delicious food, as a gathering place for company. The lack of people and food, and the empty counters, leave it feeling like a cold, sterile environment. The lack of seating at the island indicates it's not a place to gather. The personality inherent to a kitchen is demonstrated through its use and presence of people, which this photo lacks.

In order to better imitate the kitchen of my home, the lighting would need to be dimmed, perhaps given a more yellow glow as a reminder of the warmth of an open hearth. Taking this photo during a time I am cooking or baking would show its usage and presence in the home. Clutter and dishes needing cleaned would give it a used feeling.
