## On Expression, II: Collingwood

- Collingwood's theory is built on two parts:
    1. Art as expression
    2. Art as imagination
- Takes the opposite approach from Tolstoy
- We must first definitively say what is art and what is not art
- Then we can build a definition of art
- "No one can define a term without first coming to terms with its usage" [paraphrased]
- Ars vs Techne
    - Ars - art
    - Techne - root for technology, etc
    - Techne is sorta like "craft", in that it's the skills and technique.
    - No distinction at Plato's time for the separation between art and craft
    - Fine Arts and Useful Arts
- Since the 'artist proper' has something to do with emotion
    - the artist expresses emotions
- "I feel, I don't know what I feel"
- You understand emotions, instead of getting rid of them
- Collingwood feels it's cheap to arouse emotion
- Art is a process of understanding one's emotions
- The spectator would come to understand the artist's emotions
