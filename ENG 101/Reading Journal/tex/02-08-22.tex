\section*{February 8, 2022}

Class today was focused on the MLA standards for citing works and standards in papers.
This standard is seems focused more on the soft sciences and liberal arts.
It's not what I'm used to in the hard science and math realm.
However, the ideas are the same, where attributing work to a person is incredibly important.
Not doing so is plagiarizing their work.

It's not going to be difficult to understand and apply, as it's mostly just a formatting issue.
\LaTeX\ should be able to handle the formatting properly for me, I'll have to explore that.

There's a lot of little details to make sure a works cited page is correctly formatted, and I'm likely to miss some of the details.
