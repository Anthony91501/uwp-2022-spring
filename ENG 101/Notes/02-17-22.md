## Discuss the role rememberance plays in the essays by Tan, Nye, and Angelou

In all three of these essays, the authors share a memory of their childhood with the reader. Tan and Nye focus on the feelings they themselves went through during these memories. Angelou's work is more using the context to discuss how the event affected her racial identity.

For Tan it was recalling a time when she was embarassed that her crush was subjected to her culture. She is attempting to share the lesson that her mother was trying to teach her about being proud of one's identity and culture. 

Nye shares a time when her and a friend made a mistake and entered another person's home thinking it was a museum. This ended with a young woman realizing a new perspective on her parents and her home, how she had not appreciated it until a random person barged in thinking it was a museum.

Angelou weaves a tale of a fight involving Joe Louis defending his title. This work relates how a boxing match was important to a people's identity, a people that had consistently been viewed as less. Joe Louis's victory was just another victory for Joe, but Angelou perceives it as a symbol of strength for her culture and race.
